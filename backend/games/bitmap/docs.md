# Bitmap Game

This program allows users to create pixel-based drawings on a grid.
Each cell represents a pixel that can be toggled on or off.

The backend stores and updates the bitmap state.
The frontend renders the grid and handles interactions.

This project demonstrates:
- 2D arrays
- coordinate mapping
- UI state synchronization
- simple graphics rendering
