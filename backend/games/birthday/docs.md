# Birthday Paradox

This simulation demonstrates the surprising probability that in a group
of people, at least two share the same birthday.

The simulation:
1. Generates random birthdays.
2. Checks for matches.
3. Runs multiple simulations to estimate probability.
4. Plots probability growth with group size.

The paradox shows that with only 23 people, the probability exceeds 50%.
